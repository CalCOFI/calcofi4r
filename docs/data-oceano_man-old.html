Bottle #’ sampling is based on the historical “bottles-hung-on-wire” sampling #’ method utilized by CalCOFI oceanographers from 1949-1993. Twenty Niskin #’ (5L), Nansen (1.25L), or Wally (2.5L) bottles with messengers were #’ attached to a winch wire and suspended vertically in (typically) 500m #’ of ocean depth. The spring-loaded bottles go into the ocean open so #’ seawater can easily flush through them. Once all 20 bottles were #’ deployed and after a 10+ minute soak for the reversing thermometers #’ to equilibrate. A messenger - 1-2lb metal weight that can clamp &amp; #’ slide freely on the wire - was clamped to the wire and released, #’ dropping onto the first bottle submerged at the surface. When closed, #’ the bottles trap seawater from a particular depth with a water-tight #’ seal. This is important since the characteristics of seawater such as #’ salinity and oxygen change with depth. It is critical to the #’ integrity of the measurement that the bottles do not leak and become #’ contaminated by seawater from different depths. #’ #’ - Nansen bottles: the top end of the Nansen bottle would release from #’ the wire, inverting the bottle, releasing its messenger. The inversion #’ of the thermometers would “break” the mercury in the reversing #’ thermometers, locking in the temperature readings. When inverted, the #’ open bottle ends closed, trapping seawater from that depth for later #’ analyses. Three thermometers - two protected, one unprotected were used #’ on bottles 200m and deeper to derive corrected bottle depth; two #’ thermometers were mounted on bottles shallower than 200m. The released #’ messenger would slide down the wire to trip the next bottle - this #’ would continue until all 20 bottles had closed. Calculating actual #’ bottle depth by comparing protected and unprotected reversing #’ thermometer readings would correct for any inaccuracy due to wire angle #’ or winch-error. In use by CalCOFI 1949 - 1966, and occasionally after #’ until CTD-Rosette implementation in 1993. #’ #’ - Niskin bottles: the messenger would strike a plunger, releasing a #’ rotating thermometer rack that would spin 180°, “breaking” the #’ mercury to lock-in the temperature readings of the reversing #’ thermometers. An internal spring would close the o-ringed end caps #’ trapping seawater. CalCOFI Niskins were metal-free &amp; latex-free to #’ allow 14C primary productivity incubation experiments to be conducted #’ with the seawater collected. Epoxy-coated springs and viton o-rings #’ were used to reduce latex toxicity and iron fertilization. After the #’ 1st bottle tripped, the messenger would travel down the wire to the #’ next bottle and so on. The person dropping the messenger would often #’ hold the wire to feel the vibration up the wire of the bottles closing. #’ Eight minutes would elapse for all the bottles to close before the #’ bottle array would be recovered. In use by CalCOFI 1966-1993. #’ #’ - “Wally” bottles were 2.5L PVC/ABS bottles designed by CalCOFI techs #’ George Anderson &amp; Walt Bryant, similar to Niskins but easier to deploy. #’ They used a single broad wire book-clamp and collected smaller water #’ volumes so were easier-quicker to attach and remove from the wire. #’ They also used epoxy-coated springs and Viton o-rings. During their #’ use, 2.5L of seawater was plenty of volume for the at-sea analyses: #’ salts, nutrients, chlorophylls, oxygens. Like Niskin bottles, after #’ the surface bottle tripped, the messenger would travel down the wire striking the next bottle plunger, closing the bottle, and releasing the next messenger. In use by CalCOFI 1988-1993. #’ #’ - CTD-rosette: 10L PVC/ABS plastic bottles are equipped with #’ epoxy-spring loaded with Viton o-rings on all surfaces that contact #’ the seawater samples. Unlike a series of bottles clamped to a winch #’ wire, the CTD-rosette is tethered and deployed on an #’ electrically-conductive winch wire. 24-10L bottles encircle the CTD #’ electronics and are rigged open using lanyards attached to the #’ central carousel hub. The CTD sensors display real-time seawater #’ measurements to a computer screen on the ship for the operator &amp; #’ other scientists to see. Based on the downcast profiles of #’ chlorophyll-a and mixed layer depth, as the CTD-rosette is raised, #’ bottles are closed electronically at specific depths by the operator. #’ Reversing thermometers have been replaced by dual CTD temperature #’ sensors. Bottles still trap seawater from specific depths in #’ leak-proof bottles for analyses on-board the ship. In use by CalCOFI #’ 1993-present. “bottle”</p>
<p>#’ Oceanographic DIC data #’ #’ @description #’ CalCOFI collects samples for inorganic carbon and total alkalinity at #’ specific stations throughout the cruise track. Seawater samples are #’ collected from several depths, preserved and brought back to SIO for #’ total inorganic carbon and total alkalinity analysis. These #’ measurements allow the calculation of pH and pCO2. The objectives of #’ these measurements are: first, the long-term characterization of the #’ inorganic carbon system and its response to changing ocean climate, #’ and second, measurements of pH in the coastal zone in order to #’ monitor the anthropogenic impact on coastal ecosystems in the #’ Southern California Bight. #’ #’ @format A data frame with 35376 rows and 82 variables #’  #’ @source  #’ @concept data #’ @details #’ DIC samples for Dave Keeling were also collected on CalCOFI stations #’ 90.70, 90.90, &amp; 90.120 from Sep 1986 (CalCOFI 8609NH) to Nov 2002 #’ (CalCOFI 0211NH). In Aug 2008, DIC sampling restarted on 7 stations, #’ grew to 10 stations in Jan 2011, and currently DIC has expanded #’ substantially. Dissolved inorganic carbon #’ (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) data have only been integrated into #’ the CalCOFI hydrographic dataset since Aug 2008, then Jan 2009 #’ through presently. Similarly, pH data have only been integrated into #’ the CalCOFI hydrographic dataset since April 2014. #’ #’ ### Codes used in data set #’ <strong>Sta_Code (Station Codes)</strong> #’ - “ST” - Standard CalCOFI Station #’ - “SCO” - SCCOOS nearshore/20m Station #’ - “NRO” - Not Regularly Occupied Original CalCOFI Station #’ - “OCO” - Occasionally CalCOFI Occupied #’ - “IMX” - IMECOCAL Occupied #’ - “NST” - Non-Standard Station #’ - “MBR” - MBARI Occupied Station #’ #’ <strong>Data_Type (Data Type)</strong> #’ - “PR” - Productivity Cast #’ - “HY” - Hydrographic Cast #’ - “10” - Ten-meter Cast #’ - “CT” - Compressed CTD Cast (Low Resolution) #’ - “MX” - Mixed CTD and Bottle Data #’ #’ **_qual, qua, or q (Quality Code; associated with discrete samples; examples: “O_qual”, “Chlqua”, “PO4q”)<strong> #’ - Blank - Data OK #’ - “4” - Value zeroed due to value below detection limit #’ - “6” - Data taken from CTD sensor #’ - “8” - Technician thinks value is suspect #’ - “9” - Missing Data #’ #’ </strong>RecInd (Record Indicator)** #’ - “3” - Observed Data #’ - “4” - Educated office guess (ghost) #’ - “5” - Data from STD or CTD sensor #’ - “6” - Duplicate Depth #’ - “7” - Interpolated to a standard depth #’ “dic”</p>
